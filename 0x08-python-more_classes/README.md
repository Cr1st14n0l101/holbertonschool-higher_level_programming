-   All the files end with a new line
-   The first line of all the files have exactly  `#!/usr/bin/python3`
-   A  `README.md`  file at the root of the  `holbertonschool-higher_level_programming`  repo, containing a description of the repository
-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of this project.
-   The code use the  `PEP 8`  style (version  `1.7.*`)
